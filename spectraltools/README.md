# SpectralFile tools

This subdirectory is not part of the original SOCRATES repository. It is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD License.

### Overview

Computing k-coefficients from a line-list is very expensive because there can be a large number of transitions for a single molecule. To speed this up, it is useful to split the process into two steps:
1. Calculating cross-sections from a line-list (at line resolution).
2. Calculating k-coefficients from the cross-sections (at a lower resolution).

Step 1 is by far the slowest, so it is helpful to use pre-computed opacities. These tools aim to generalise the creation of SpectralFiles from pre-computed opacity tables by converting them into a common netCDF format. These netCDF files can then be read by SOCRATES when generating SpectralFiles with the required properties.

**You will need to download the source cross-sections yourself**. For a given database (`db`) and absorber (`ab`), the files should be placed in the directory `data/db/ab/`. All output files will be written to `output/`, which **you will also need to create yourself** or create a symbolic link called `output` which points to another extant location. The tools are primarily targeted at parsing cross-sections from DACE, with other databases partially supported for comparison purposes. It is recommended that you download cross-sections using the `Tinterpolate_dace.py` tool, and then generate spectral files using `Tmake_spectralfile.py`.

These tools all operate by storing the spectral absorption cross-section (versus wavenumber) of an absorber (at a given temperature and pressure) in an `xsec` Python object. This is defined in `src/cross.py`. The various sources can be loaded into this object, and then written as a netCDF, plotted, or otherwise manipulated as required.
